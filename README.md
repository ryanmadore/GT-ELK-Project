# GT-ELK-Project
In this project you will find scripts utilized across the Linux and Ansible weeks covered in class. This will be complete with a network diagram of the Microsoft Azure environment. Additionally, you will find all scripts used to setup and configure the ELK container on my local machine, including the hosts file that signifies trusted IP addresses allowed to access. Scripts utilized in the Linux week of class can also be found inside the Linux folder.
